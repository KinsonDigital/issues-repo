      Reasons for local unit test execution:
      - Unit tests might pass locally but not in the CI environment during the status check process or vice-versa.
      - Tests might pass on the developer's machine but not necessarily on the code reviewer's machine.

      The release notes go into a sub folder in the **_Release Notes_** folder.
      The type of release depends on where the release notes are stored.
      - **Preview Release Notes** go into the **_~/Documentation/ReleaseNotes/PreviewReleases_** folder.
      - **Production Release Notes** go into the **_~/Documentation/ReleaseNotes/ProductionReleases_** folder.

      Release note files are in markdown format and the name must follow a particular syntax.
      This is so the CI/CD can automatically pick up the release notes and add them as assets to the release.

      #### Release Notes File Name Syntax:
      - **Preview Release Notes:**
        - **Syntax:** Release-Notes-v\<_major_\>.\<_minor_\>.\<_patch_\>-preview.\<_prev-num_\>.md
        - **Example:** Release-Notes-v1.0.0-preview.4.md
      - **Production Release Notes:**
        - **Syntax:** Release-Notes-v\<_major_\>.\<_minor_\>.\<_patch_\>.md
        - **Example:** Release-Notes-v1.0.0.md

      Any changes such as release notes and version updates should be committed to the release branch being released.
